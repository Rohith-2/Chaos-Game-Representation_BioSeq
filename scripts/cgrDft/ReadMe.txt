1. Please run Main.m file! 
2. Please notice that the phylogenetic tree generated by matlab 
   might look different than the trees in the paper (which is generated by 
   MEGA 6), but they actually have the same topology. If you want to generate
   phylogenetic tree with better visualization, please use the .meg file 
   (generated in the same folder after you run the corresponding dataset)
   and draw the tree using MEGA 6. 
   
Thank you!
